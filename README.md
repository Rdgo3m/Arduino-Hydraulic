# Arduino-Hydraulic-Controller
Digital Controller - PI, to operate hydraulic system applying microcontroller - Arduino UNO

With the evolution of embedded technology, programmed microcontrollers are likely to be implemented to operate automated hydraulic systems, controlling motor pumps according to the needs imposed by process variables. This work focuses on verify the automatic drive viability of hydraulic pumps, using microcontrollers, according to the state of tank levels detected by sensors, as well as monitoring and accomplishing data acquisition inherent in the system. To perform field tests, a prototype was built to repress water between water tanks, in order to analyze the reliability and accuracy of the components, as well as the values obtained. It might thus improve the knowledge related to hydraulic automation, and achieve satisfactory results through the research project realized, which may serve as a basis for future construction of embedded automated systems for hydraulic drive motor pumps.
